# Overview

## The Problem

It's common practice for students to search for professor ratings before registering for a class. However, this process can be time-consuming and tedious, especially when looking for information on multiple classes.

User Interface (UI) frameworks like Bootstrap have gained widespread popularity due to their ability to simplify the process of building responsive, mobile-first websites. However, the use of UI frameworks also introduces a variety of complexities that can make it difficult for developers to use. Learning what each class does in bootstrap is like learning the syntax of a new programming language. Frameworks like React have large learning curves in setting up the development environment alone. New tools, configuration files, and endless settings are possible, and in order to effectively use the service, one needs to know the pros and cons of each one.

## The Solution

Streamlining the process of searching for courses and looking up professors' ratings can save students a considerable amount of time and effort.

# Mockup page ideas

To create an efficient and user-friendly platform, we propose the following mockup pages:

- New user goes to the landing page, creates an account, gets directed to profile/myclasses page where they can click on a class availability tab, then add classes to their profile whilst the class also provides a link to the professors rating on ratemyprofessor.

## Pages:

- Home Page: Landing page displaying sign-in/sign-up options.
- Login Page: Displays the login page for users to access their account.
- Signup Page: Allows users to create a new account.
- My Class (Profile): Displays the user's selected class cards, which they can manage.
- Availability Page (Add): Displays all ICS class cards available for the user to add to their profile.

# Use case ideas

The platform caters primarily to ICS students who need to register for classes. Use case ideas for the platform include:

- During registration, ICS students can view their available classes and the professor's Rate my professor pages.

- Acquiring general information on classes through the platform.

# Beyond the basics

To expand the capabilities of the platform, we suggest the following additional features:

- Add, remove, update class availability (Admin): An admin account can manage class availability by adding or removing classes and updating any changes.

- Filter majors instead of viewing just ICS: Users can filter classes by majors other than ICS to cater to a broader range of students.

- Add additional majors, other than just ICS: The platform can expand its reach by adding other majors besides ICS.

- Add a web scraper that will dynamically update the data displayed every semester: To ensure that the platform remains up to date, a web scraper can be integrated to extract and update data dynamically.
