*Javascript has turned into a monster, but is it already too late...*

##Software Engineering

I really love coding. It speaks to me on sort of a personal level. I don’t like subjectivity, and coding is always discrete and always follows the laws of it’s technology stack. Nothing is left to interpretation. Either your program works or it doesn’t. Not many environments in the world are so absolute. I enjoy being a part of the software community because it feels like I have complete control of the work I do and the products I create.

## AI
But in a more technical sense, I would like to learn how large software systems are built and maintained and deployed effectively. I would also like to learn the ins and outs of machine learning, due to the disruptive nature this technology will have. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, believes AI will have an impact comparable to the magnitude of a new technological innovation. This means AI will be as impactful as antibiotics, the steam engine, electricity, or the discovery of fire. This is an extremely exciting time to be alive and I’m eager to participate in building the world’s AI infrastructure.

## Business Ambition
I really want to start a business one day, and I know it will be a tech company. One day in 2020, I watched “The Social Network” which tells Mark Zuckerberg’s story. He started Facebook on his own in his dorm, which he grew into a large tech goliath. I realized impacting lives at the scale of billions is only possible with computers. His story was very inspirational. I also believe there are so many untapped areas where computers can make a difference. Humans are doing too many labor related jobs. It's well known that we have the mechanical resources and know-how to automate just about anything. Robotics software is the only thing holding us back which is another exciting and disruptive field I’d like to take a stab at.

## Plan of Execution
In college I plan on soaking up as much knowledge as possible. I’ve been going out of my way to make friends and talk to others and keep the like minded ones close. I hope to join many clubs and projects and acquire the widest breadth of experiences possible. Then I’ll take all I’ve learned and hit the real world. My plan is to find a small problem out in the world that I can solve with computers and then solve it. Then I’ll start building a team and expand. Rinse and repeat a few times and before I know it, I’ll be having dinner with the president, advising him on what flavor of AI he should install in the white house.
